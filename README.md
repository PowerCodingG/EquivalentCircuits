</figure>

Here is a C++ CLI program that enables the user to combine resistors or capacitors in series and parallel, when solving for equivalent circuits, without the need of having to open a calcualtor or write out any lengthy expressions. 

<h2> How to Compile in Terminal</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Run <code>g++ main.cpp</code> </li>
  <li>Run <code>./a.out</code> to start program </li>
  <li>Answer the questions that pop up and enter your values to combine the resistors or capacitors </li>
</ul>


Thank you for your interest in the project and enjoy.
