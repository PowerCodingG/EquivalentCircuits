<h1> EquivalentCircuitsCalculator </h1>
A C++ program that enables the user to combine resistors or capacitors in series and parallel, when solving for equivalent circuits, without the need of having to open a calcualtor or write out any lengthy expressions. 

<h2> How to Compile </h2>
Use g++ to compile the main.cpp script, such as "g++ main.cpp" and then start the program by entering "./a.out" or any other name you gave your compiled file.
If you are using an IDE there is likely no need to compile just run the file as you normally would in the directory that you save programs/scripts on.

Thank you for checking the project and enjoy.
